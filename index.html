            <p>There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. This is probably the greatest thing to happen in my life - to be able to share this with you. A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these things just sort of happen. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>

            <p>Now then, let's play. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees.</p>
            
            <p>The least little bit can do so much. Have fun with it. Don't be bashful drop me a line. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.</p>
            
            <p>I thought today we would make a happy little stream that's just running through the woods here. Let's do that again. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>
            
            <p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. In your world you can create anything you desire. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p>
            
            <p>Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>
            
            <p>If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. The light is your friend. Preserve it.</p>
